## 📋 Quick Scenario Guide

| Round | Scenario | Time | Trap/Lesson |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|
| **1** | MDRO Moral Injury | 10 min | None need negative pressure - tests resource allocation |
| **2** | HIV Labs Lie | 8 min | Undetectable ≠ invincible; symptoms > labs |
| **3** | SATA Hell | 10 min | CD4 irrelevant for PrEP (trap answer) |
| **4** | Priority Flip | 10 min | Neuro symptoms > worst lab value |
| **5** | Needle Stick | 7 min | PEP can't wait for complete info |

**Total Time:** 45-60 minutes (including discussion)

---

## 🎯 Teaching Kill Shots (Use After Each Round)

### Round 1
> "NCLEX doesn't test what's right. It tests whether you can explain why the others are worse."

### Round 2
> "Undetectable doesn't mean invincible. CD4 count determines OI risk."

### Round 3
> "Know what doesn't matter. PrEP is prevention, not treatment."

### Round 4
> "The sickest patient is not always the one with the worst labs."

### Round 5
> "NCLEX punishes delayed urgency. Time-sensitive interventions can't wait."

## ⚠️ Common Student Mistakes

| Scenario | Student Trap | Correction |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| MDRO | Pick lowest CD4 | None actually need neg. pressure |
| HIV Labs | Dismiss symptoms | Symptoms override reassuring labs |
| SATA | Pick CD4 count | Only for HIV+ patients, not PrEP |
| Priority | Pick lowest CD4 | Acute neuro = emergency regardless |
| Needle Stick | Wait for info | Start PEP while investigating |

## 🏆 What to Grade On

**✅ GRADE THIS:**
- Quality of reasoning
- Ability to explain risk trade-offs
- Understanding why other options are worse
- Clinical judgment process

**❌ DON'T GRADE THIS:**
- "Getting it right"
- Speed
- Confidence

## 💬 Facilitation Tips

### Before Starting
1. ✅ Form groups of 3-4
2. ✅ Read the rules (exactly as written)
3. ✅ Set timer for each scenario
4. ✅ Emphasize: "There is NO perfect answer"

### During Discussion
1. 🎤 Let groups present first
2. 🤔 Ask: "Why is X worse than Y?"
3. 🔥 Encourage debate between groups
4. ⏸️ Don't reveal answer until all groups present

### After Each Scenario
1. 📚 Present the "best bad answer"
2. 🧠 Explain why it's LEAST dangerous
3. ⚠️ Highlight the student traps
4. 🎯 Connect to NCLEX strategy

## 🚨 If Students Get Stuck

**Prompt with these questions:**
- "What's the IMMEDIATE risk of each option?"
- "Which patient is most vulnerable RIGHT NOW?"
- "What can wait? What can't?"
- "Which option creates the most danger?"

---

## 🎓 Debrief Template

After all 5 rounds, discuss:

1. **What made this hard?**
   - Ambiguity, competing priorities, no perfect answer

2. **How is this different from regular NCLEX questions?**
   - Real nursing = choosing between imperfect options

3. **What did you learn about clinical judgment?**
   - Symptoms > labs
   - Time matters
   - Resources are limited
   - You must justify decisions

4. **How will this help on NCLEX?**
   - Answer elimination strategy
   - "Least wrong" thinking
   - Justifying priority choices

## 📊 Assessment Rubric (Optional)

| Criteria | Novice (1) | Competent (2) | Proficient (3) |
|----------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Risk Assessment** | Identifies 1-2 risks | Identifies most risks | Identifies all risks + severity |
| **Justification** | Vague reasoning | Clear reasoning | Detailed comparison of all options |
| **Clinical Judgment** | Focuses on one factor | Considers multiple factors | Integrates all clinical data |
| **Communication** | Unclear | Clear | Persuasive and evidence-based |

---

## 🔥 Advanced Extension: "Defend the Wrong Answer"

**After completing all 5 rounds:**

1. Pick the WORST answer from any scenario
2. Say: **"Convince me this is right."**
3. Have students argue for it
4. Then tear it apart together

**Why this works:**
- Trains answer elimination
- Shows flaws in wrong answers
- Builds confidence in process

---

## 💡 Real-World Connections

Help students see this isn't just academic:

- **MDRO scenario** = Every shift with isolation rooms
- **HIV labs** = Common clinic presentation
- **PrEP requirements** = Public health nursing
- **Priority decisions** = Every shift, every day
- **Needle stick** = Occupational hazard management

---

## 📈 Success Indicators

Students are "getting it" when they:
- ✅ Stop looking for "the right answer"
- ✅ Start comparing risks instead
- ✅ Ask "which is LEAST dangerous?"
- ✅ Justify choices with clinical reasoning
- ✅ Get comfortable with ambiguity

---

## 🎯 NCLEX Alignment

This directly prepares for:
- ✅ NCSBN Clinical Judgment Model
- ✅ NGN question types (especially unfolding cases)
- ✅ Priority/delegation questions
- ✅ SATA questions with no perfect combo

---

## ⏱️ Time Management

**Suggested breakdown (total 60 min):**
- Intro/rules: 5 min
- Round 1: 10 min (5 discuss + 5 debrief)
- Round 2: 8 min (4 discuss + 4 debrief)
- Round 3: 10 min (5 discuss + 5 debrief)
- Round 4: 10 min (5 discuss + 5 debrief)
- Round 5: 7 min (3 discuss + 4 debrief)
- Final debrief: 10 min

**Can shorten by:**
- Reducing discussion time
- Skipping some scenarios
- Assigning scenarios to different groups

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"Students are too frustrated"**
→ Remind: "This is SUPPOSED to be hard. That's real nursing."

**"Groups can't agree"**
→ Perfect! That's the point. Have them present both views.

**"They want the 'real' answer"**
→ "There isn't one. That's the lesson."

**"Takes too long"**
→ Cut to 3 scenarios (Rounds 1, 2, 4) for shorter sessions.

## 🎉 Remember

**If students leave feeling uncomfortable = SUCCESS**

You're not here to make them feel good.
You're here to make them **think like nurses**.
