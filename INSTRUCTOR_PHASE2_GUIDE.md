# Quick Start: Phase 2 - Resource Management

## What Changed? 🆕

"A Day to be Wrong" now features **limited resources** and **escalating crises**. Wrong answers trigger additional emergency questions.

## The Three Resources

```
Start of Game:
🚪 ISO: 1    (Isolation Room)
🚨 PASS: 1   (Emergency Pass)
📞 MD: 1     (Provider Call)
```

**Once used, they're gone.** Students must decide WHEN to use them.

## How It Works

### Normal Path (All Correct)
```
5 questions → Done
All resources intact
Score: +50
```

### With Mistakes
```
Q1 wrong → 🚨 C. diff outbreak question appears
Q2 wrong → 🚨 Seizure crisis question appears
Q4 wrong → 🚨 Code blue question appears
Q5 wrong → 🚨 PEP disaster question appears

Possible total: 9 questions (5 + 4 escalations)
```

## The Four Escalations

| Triggered By | Crisis | Requires | Stakes |
|--------------|--------|----------|--------|
| Q1 (MDRO) | C. diff outbreak | 🚨 Pass | Unit under investigation |
| Q2 (HIV labs) | Patient seizing | 📞 MD Call | Cryptococcal meningitis |
| Q4 (Priority) | Code blue | 🚪 ISO Room | Staff exposure risk |
| Q5 (Needle stick) | PEP window closing | 🚨 Pass | 4hr delay, lawsuit risk |

## What Students Experience

### Resource Depletion Warning
```
⚠️ This question requires an EMERGENCY PASS 
but you've already used it! Choose the best alternative.
```

### Resource Used Notification
```
✅ EMERGENCY PASS used wisely. Rapid bleach cleaning 
prevents spread. Outbreak contained.
[Resource consumed: emergencyPasses]
```

### Escalation Counter
```
Question 7 / 9  🚨 ESCALATION LEVEL 2
```

## Instructor Tips

### Before Play
**Set Expectations**:
- "You have THREE critical resources"
- "Wrong answers create MORE questions"
- "Once used, resources are GONE"
- "This simulates real resource constraints"

### During Play (if watching)
Watch for:
- **Panic when resources deplete** (teachable moment about scarcity)
- **Strategic hesitation** (good! they're thinking)
- **Frustration at escalations** (real consequence awareness)

### After Play - Discussion

#### 1. Resource Usage
**Ask**: "Did anyone finish with all 3 resources intact?"
- **If yes**: Excellent! No mistakes triggered escalations
- **If no**: "Which resource did you use? Was it worth it?"

#### 2. Escalation Experience
**Ask**: "How many got escalation questions?"
- Count: Who got 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4?
- Discuss: "Which crisis was hardest to manage?"

#### 3. Resource Regret
**Ask**: "Did anyone wish they'd saved a resource for later?"
- Connect to real nursing: "Only 1 ICU bed, 3 critical patients"
- Or: "One rapid response team, two codes happening"

#### 4. The "No Perfect Answer" Realization
**Ask**: "What happened when you needed a resource but it was gone?"
- This is the point! Sometimes nurses have NO good options
- All choices are bad - pick least bad

## Real-World Parallels

| Game Scenario | Real Nursing |
|---------------|--------------|
| 1 Isolation Room | Limited negative pressure rooms |
| 1 Emergency Pass | Manager override, break protocol |
| 1 Provider Call | Stat consults (limited availability) |
| C. diff outbreak | Infection control crisis |
| Resource depletion | Working short-staffed |

## Common Student Reactions

### "This is unfair! I ran out of resources!"
**Response**: "Exactly. Real nurses work with limited resources. What did you learn about prioritization?"

### "I got 9 questions, they got 5!"
**Response**: "Because your decisions had consequences. Just like real patient care - errors compound."

### "I didn't know it would trigger more questions!"
**Response**: "Real mistakes don't come with warnings either. That's why FIRST decision is critical."

## Grading Suggestions

### Option 1: Completion-Based (Participation)
- Played the module = Full credit
- Focus on learning, not punishment

### Option 2: Performance-Based
- **A**: 0-1 escalations triggered
- **B**: 2 escalations
- **C**: 3-4 escalations
- **Allow retakes** - this is skill building!

### Option 3: Reflection-Based
Full credit for:
1. Playing the module
2. Writing 1-page reflection:
   - Which resource did you use?
   - What would you do differently?
   - How does this apply to clinical?

## When to Assign

### ✅ Good Timing
- After infection control lecture (Ch 18-19)
- Before hospital clinical rotations
- During critical thinking unit
- As prep for Next Gen NCLEX

### ⏸️ Wait Until...
- Students understand basic infection control
- They've completed regular chapters
- They're ready for high-pressure scenarios

## Quick Troubleshooting

### "Students are panicking about escalations"
**Solution**: Frame it as learning, not punishment. "Mistakes help you learn - that's why we practice!"

### "They want to replay to avoid escalations"
**Great!** That's the point - learning from mistakes. Allow replays.

### "Someone triggered all 4 escalations and gave up"
**Intervention**: "This is EXACTLY when nurses can't give up. What did you learn about staying focused under pressure?"

## Success Indicators

Students are "getting it" when they say:
- ✅ "I saved my resources for emergencies"
- ✅ "I learned C. diff doesn't need negative pressure"
- ✅ "Wrong answer caused the outbreak - I see the chain"
- ✅ "Next time I'll prioritize differently"

## Phase 3 Sneak Peek
