# Quick Reference: Phase 1 Enhancements

## What Changed? 🆕

**"A Day to be Wrong"** now features **timed consequences** - students see immediate patient outcomes for their choices.

## Student View

### Timer Display (Top Right)
```
Green text: "⏱️ 60s" (plenty of time)
Yellow text: "⏱️ 15s" (getting close)
Red pulsing: "⏱️ 5s" (urgent!)
```

### After Answer - Consequence Box
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⚖️ CONSEQUENCE                           │
│                                          │
│ ❌ C. diff spreads! Two more patients    │
│ develop diarrhea. Unit now under         │
│ investigation for outbreak.              │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Scoring
- ✅ Correct fast: **+10 points**
- ✅ Correct slow (>45s): **+3 points** (hesitation penalty)
- ❌ Wrong answer: **-10 points**
- ⏱️ Timeout: **0 points**

## Question Timing

| Scenario | Time | Rationale |
|----------|------|-----------|
| **Needle Stick** | 30s | Emergency - PEP window critical |
| **Priority Flip** | 45s | Acute assessment - need speed |
| **MDRO Isolation** | 60s | Standard judgment call |
| **HIV Labs** | 60s | Interpretation + decision |
| **SATA PrEP** | 90s | Multiple factors, complex |

## Instructor Tips

### Why Use This Mode?
- **Builds pressure management**: Simulates ED/acute care pace
- **Consequence awareness**: Students see "what could happen"
- **Priority training**: All options are wrong - which is safest?
- **Clinical reasoning**: Time pressure reveals true understanding

### When to Assign
✅ **Good for**:
- After covering infection control (Ch 18-19)
- Before clinical rotations
- High-acuity/critical care prep
- NCLEX Next Gen practice

❌ **Not ideal for**:
- First-time content exposure
- Students struggling with basic concepts
- Study mode review (use regular chapters)

### Discussion Points After Play
1. "Which decision surprised you?" (Check consequences)
2. "Why did you hesitate?" (Look at >45s questions)
3. "What would you do differently?" (Learn from -10s)

## Common Student Questions

**Q: "Why am I losing points for correct answers?"**  
A: If you took >45 seconds, you get +3 instead of +10. In real emergencies, delayed correct decisions can still harm patients.

**Q: "Can I replay questions?"**  
A: Yes! Anti-memorization allows 3 attempts per 24 hours. Use it to improve response time.

**Q: "What if I run out of time?"**  
A: 0 points. This teaches assessment speed - critical for high-acuity environments.

**Q: "Why are all answers wrong?"**  
A: To teach prioritization. Real nursing = choosing least dangerous option when perfect isn't possible.

## Analytics to Watch

Check student performance for:
- **Timeout patterns** → Need assessment speed practice
- **Negative scores** → Need priority concepts
- **High hesitation** (many +3s) → Confidence building needed
- **Fast +10s** → Ready for Next Gen questions!

## Phase 2 Preview (Coming Soon)
- Resource management (isolation rooms, emergency passes)
- Progressive difficulty (wrong answers trigger worse situations)
- Escalation chains (consequences snowball)
